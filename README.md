# DatTweak
A collection of purely functional tweaks for Minecraft 1.8.9

## Torch Drop
If a Player is sneaking while dropping a torch (either normal or redstone) it will place itself upon hitting the ground

## Wiggle
Using the defined hotkey, the Player can offset the placement of any blocks, in one of the six directions. If the hotkey is pressed while sneaking, it will toggle between offsetting the position based on the target block's position, or the position based on the target side
